DistributedEvents
=================

This is very simple application to send events to interested subscribers. 

1. Define custom event types 
2. Subscribers say I am interested in so and so events
3. Publishers publishes events 
4. Event Registry dispatches events to interested subscribers. 

TO DO : 

1. Provide different event store provisions  (In memory/ Messaging/ NoSql Engine)
2. Make this code to be completely distributed 
3. Add priority for eventing
4. Multi-threaded processing
